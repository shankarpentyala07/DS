        if(target >= letters[n-1])
            return letters[0];
        
        int i=0,j=n-1;
        
       // char target = (char) (target + 1);
        while(i<j)
        {
            int mid = i+(j-i)/2;
            if(letters[mid] <= target)
                i=mid+1;
            else
                j=mid;
        }
        
        return letters[i];
    }
