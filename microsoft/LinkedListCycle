Fast Slow Pointer Approach:
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if(head ==null || head.next == null)
            return false;
        
        ListNode fast=head,slow = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null)
        {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if(slow == fast)
                return true;
        }
        
        return false;
        
    }
}
Time: O(N+K) 
Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Let us denote nn as the total number of nodes in the linked list. To analyze its time complexity, we consider the following two cases separately.

List has no cycle:
The fast pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is O(n)O(n).

List has a cycle:
We break down the movement of the slow pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:

The slow pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. \text{Number of iterations} = \text{non-cyclic length} = NNumber of iterations=non-cyclic length=N

Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes \dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}} 
difference of speed
distance between the 2 runners
â€‹	
  loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner. As the distance is at most "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K" and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
\text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}Number of iterations=almost "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K".

Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(N+K)O(N+K), which is O(n)O(n).

Space complexity : O(1)O(1). We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1)O(1).

HashSet Solution:

public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    Set<ListNode> nodesSeen = new HashSet<>();
    while (head != null) {
        if (nodesSeen.contains(head)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            nodesSeen.add(head);
        }
        head = head.next;
    }
    return false;
}
