ex: Array is nums1
left = 0, right = nums1.length-1 or right =nums1.length
Here the values of left and right are the possible values.
In a binary search,the possible values are 0 <-> nums1.length-1
In a median of two sorted Arrays,the possible values are 0 <-> num1.length as for an array of size n ,there are n+1 possible partitions
