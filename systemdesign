Messaging guarantees are an important part of designing systems. We look at 3 guarantees for messaging:

1) Guaranteed delivery ensures that the message reaches the client once it is received on the server. This is done using replays.
2) Ordered delivery is a crucial feature in many services. It ensures that messages are either received in order of receiving or not at all.
3) Idempotency ensures that duplicate messages during retrial are ignored by the next system.

These guarantees are achieved using retrial, dedicated threads or message queues per set of users and checks for duplicates.
